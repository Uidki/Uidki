## What Is Pawno.exe?
ok, so this is it, but this is just my opinion hehehe ok so Pawno is an application for Wine/Windows _(I don't know if it works on Linux I think)_ which is based on Include, now include is what will make Pawno work according to the Include, the file that was originally in the form  `.pwn` will be changed to `.amx` (that's called compile), so if your server or Samp server is activated but there is no `.amx` file your server won't start

## What are Gamemodes?
Hmmm, this should be familiar to small Devs or those who usually have Samp Servers, but I'll still explain why
Ok gamemode is a folder filled with several other folders, Gamemode (_Gm_) can also be said to be like a folder to activate your Sercer Samp and also contains files that are needed by Server Samp, like `.pwn` `.amx` `.inc` `.so` Etc, it is also important for the server to be up
