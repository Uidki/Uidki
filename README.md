Hi, Iâ€™m @Uidki
I'm Uidki, I'm a scripting pwno with a file format >.pwn <, I will always develop Samp server features, and I have Discrod too, here's the link > https://discord.gg/AytBdFTE < every script I share with the public  , it's not original that it will succeed in compiling the pwn, or you can say indirectly in the form of .amx, because each Samp server has its own Gamemodes, and of course it is very different from my .pwn structure and the .pwn server, so every Script pwn that I  Give it to the public, please pay attention!
